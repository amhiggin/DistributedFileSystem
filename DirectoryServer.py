# TODO implement
#
# Directory server should have a hashtable.
# - File id is generated from the name
# - For a new file received, this should be given a unique name.
# - Then, this should be posted to the server which is least-loaded at that time.
# - This means the dir server will need to know how many files each fileserver has.
