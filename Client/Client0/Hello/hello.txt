Creating another file of the same name on a different client
Just to see if there ends up being a conflict :)

Now I want to see whether the fileserver will throw a unicode exception
I think it was only doing it because I was trying to read the file I had just updated, remotely


Making a few more changes
Still haven't been able to test this accurately

Now trying to do a second write


It worked the last time, but now correcting an erroneous message
